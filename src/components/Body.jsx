          is a compilation of aphorisms and teachings by Chanakya, also known as
          Kautilya or Vishnugupta, who was an ancient Indian teacher,
          philosopher, economist, and advisor to Emperor Chandragupta Maurya.
          His strategic acumen and insights laid the foundation for the Maurya
          Empire in ancient India, and his works continue to be highly regarded
          for their practical wisdom on various aspects of life, governance, and
          personal conduct.
